Implementation of TI-DBSCAN algorithm


Description
===========
Proposition of using triangle inequality 
property (TI) to reduce the number of
candidates for being a member of Eps-neighboorhood
of a given point.

Major challenges in DBSCAN
* efficient calculation of eps-neightborhood for each of points
* dbscan uses the R*-tree index
* the use of such indices helps in the case of low dimensional data only
